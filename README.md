# DLPROJECT
THIS IS MY PROJECT FOR DEEP LEARNING.
I have used a dataset containing RBC images of patients suffering from maleria as wel as normal patient's blood.
The medical image set is the dataset i have chosen and based on this dataset , this deep learning model will detect the presence of maleria or not in a given patient's body blood sample.

I have used python libraries and deep learning model (CNN) Convolutional Neural Networks, is a deep learning model.
